    		The postgresql.conf comparison tool was created to
    		make it easier to track changes to the database's main configuration file.
	      	These configuration options, referred to by the Pg hackers as
	      	GUCs
	      	(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/acronyms.html">
	      	Grand Unified Configuration</a>),
	      	do change over time with major versions.  These changes typically reflect new features added, existing features
	      	improved, and other changes.

            and prepare for upgrading PostgreSQL major versions.

            Configuration data is available for Postgres 10 and newer.
            Configurations for new versions will be added as they are released.

            NOTE: This tool previously included Postgres versions 9.2 through 9.6.
            Those versions were not included during the rewrite from using
            `postgresql.conf` directly to using the more robust comparison
            from `pg_catalog.pg_settings` data.
